This process combines both cast and handmade elements like sanding and buffing, putting an artisan's personal connection and love of their craft on display.<br><br> There are many considerations to manufacturing fine navel jewelry. It’s everything from the materials and the quality of stones to ensuring a consistent curvature of the bar and threading.  Although you tend to be drawn to the look and feel of a belly ring or maybe just the sparkle, your experience is ultimately dictated by how comfortable it is to wear.<br><br> We are extremely critical of all these considerations.  Quality craftmanship is not just a promise…it’s an integral part of every single aspect of manufacturing. It’s about combining processes, state-of-the-art equipment, and the skill of master artisans.<br><br> But above all this, there is yet one more consideration.  It is our commitment to an ethical approach to business and environment friendly processes. We are proud to have partnered with an organization that is certified by Sedex and does more than just share this commitment - approximately 40% of the energy used to manufacture our products is generated via solar panels.<br><br> <b>Materials: <\/b><br><br> All alloys used in the mix of our 14k solid gold and the 925 silver which is 100% recycled are sourced through one of the largest and most accredited precious metal refiners in the United States.

You can be certain it adheres to the highest standards, such as the Responsible Jewelry Council (RJC), Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI – RMAP), SCS: Global Services and Conflict Free Gold. <br><br>White gold is a beautiful, modern alternative to traditional yellow gold. But many people don't realize that white gold isn't actually pure white. Like most other types of gold used in jewelry, white gold is an alloy of gold and other metals. Our 14k White Gold consists of 58.5% of pure gold and is Nickel-Free. <br><br>So where does the white color come from? It's actually from the thin layer of rhodium plating that gives white gold jewelry its high luster and bright white color. Rhodium plating also has the benefit of lasting longer on white gold. And because rhodium does not contain allergens, it's a great choice for those with sensitive skin. So, if you're looking for a beautiful, modern option, white gold is the perfect choice. <br><br>Because Jolie Co also rhodium plates all its 925 sterling silver charms you can easily match them up with a 14k solid white gold bar.

Vermeil is made by bonding a thick layer of 18k Gold (at least five times higher than regular gold-plated jewelry) to a base of 925 Sterling Silver, making it stronger and giving it the luxurious look and feel of yellow gold. But not all Gold Vermeil is equal.  \nAt Jolie Co we apply a thick 3-micron layer of 18k gold onto a 925 Sterling Silver.  In addition, we also apply a clear e-coating which ensures the piece lasts longer when exposed to the elements.  <br><br>The 14k gold vermeil charms can be matched with a 14k solid yellow gold bar – they may look identical, but your pocket will sure thank you.",

Rhodium is a rare metal and commonly used in fine jewelry. The rhodium plating both strengthens and protects delicate metals from corrosion and tarnishing by creating a beautiful reflective white finish.

            "answer": "For anyone considering a new piercing, it is important to be aware of the different types of threading available. A professional piercer will always recommend an internally threaded belly bar as it provides a smoother insertion since there are no threads on the outside of the barbell to catch on raw tissue. They are also more difficult to manufacture which is why the external threading is much more common in low-priced belly bars. <br><br> Externally threaded belly bars tend to be much more susceptible to irritation and infection as the threads are like little, tiny knives and can catch on the delicate tissue, leading to cuts, scrapes, and inflammation.  In addition, bacteria can easily become trapped in the nooks and crannies of the threading, increasing the risk of infection. <br><br> You may use externally threaded body jewelry if your piercing is well-healed.

            "answer": "Whether you are just getting pierced or looking for a change, you need to consider the material the jewelry is made of and the type of threading. Check out our “What you need to know” blog posts. <br><br> Everyone reacts to metal sensitivities differently, there are some symptoms to watch out for. <b>Itching, redness, swelling, soreness, and warmth <\/b>at the exposed area are all signs that you’re allergic to the metals in your jewelry.  <br><br> Regardless of whether you know how your skin reacts to certain materials the wises choice is to always choose a material that is less likely to give you a reaction. Your piece will be more comfortable to wear.  <br><br> The type of threading is equally important as externally threaded belly bars tend to be much more susceptible to irritation and infection as the threads are like little, tiny knives and can catch on the delicate tissue, leading to cuts, scrapes, and inflammation.  In addition, bacteria can easily become trapped in the nooks and crannies of the threading, increasing the risk of infection. <br><br>  <b>For new piercings: <\/b><br><br> You should never use any type of plated materials or those that contain nickel.  The safest materials for new piercings are 14k solid gold, implant grade 316L or 316LVM surgical steel compliant to ASTM F138, and titanium grade 5 TI6AL4V alloy or grade 23 Ti6AL4V ELI alloy compliant to ASTM F136.  <br><br> And remember, your professional piercing studio has a responsibility to educate you on the materials and types of threading before you get pierced.  But some piercers are flat out busy and don’t take the time to explain or even worse just profit driven.  And so – do your own research – it is your body and the ultimate responsibility to protect yourself is on you! <br><br> <b>For healed piercings: <\/b><br><br> Many believe that any material is safe to wear once your piercing has healed and that is simply not true.  For example, not all surgical steel meets the safe specifications as set out by ASTM.  <br><br> So many “gold plated belly rings” compete for your attention but gold plating is an extremely challenging and complex process.  Don't get fooled by cheap gold-plated jewelry. It’s not safe or practical. The thin layers of gold plating wear out quickly and the flaking and exposure to the underlying materials can cause irritation and infections no matter where you are in your piercing journey.  <br><br> Do you research and carefully review the materials no matter where you are in your piercing journey – especially if you are hypersensitive.",
